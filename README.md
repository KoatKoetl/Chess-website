# Chess Website
This is a landing of chess website, which I did for the Yandex Craud. </br>
The task was to create it using only HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Any library or framework aren't welcome. </br>
The task was easy for me, but took some time to understand how to correctly place all the stuff on page, to make it responsive.

## The tasks set

* Adhere to the Pixel Perfect principle.
* Avoid duplicate text content in the mobile and desktop versions.
* Add tickers and other animations as you see fit.
* Buttons on the start screen are anchors and lead to relevant blocks.
* The carousel with participant cards should be looped and change automatically every 4 seconds.
* The carousel with stages should not be looped and should not automatically change slides.
